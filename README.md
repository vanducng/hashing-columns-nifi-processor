# Nifi custom processor
## Introduction
Nifi was designed as a data flow management which is to move pieces of data from point A to point B. The transformation in between is kept as minimum with simple cases support like text replaced, etc. Since any modification to data flow will impact the performance as well as the design philosophy.

However, there is always the need in certain situation that required a complex data manipulation. 

This project is develop a custom Nifi processor to perform the task of hashing specific field name  
    
This project is to build a custom processor to perform the task of hashing specific columns with interested algorithms including: MD2, MD5, SHA224, SHA256 and SHA512
